# My phase 1 project for Flatiron school
I used a database from balldontlie.io to make a web application that searches any NBA player's name (retired or current) and brings back a card containing their full name, full team name, team abbreviation, and position listed on that team. I added a "Save to favorites" and "Home" button to the card to either save to the favorites list page or go back to the homepage. When the user clicks "Save to favorites" they are then directed to the favorites list page which holds a list of each player's full name and team.
