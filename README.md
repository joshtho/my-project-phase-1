# My phase 1 project for Flatiron school
I used a database from balldontlie.io to make a web application that searches any NBA player's name (retired or current) and brings back a card containing their full name, full team name, and position listed on that team. I added a "Save to favorites" and "Home" button to the card to either save to the favorites list page or go back to the homepage. The favorites list page is instantly updated using db.json whenever the user clicks "Save to favorites". The user can save their favorite players along with their team names into a list located on the favoirites page.
